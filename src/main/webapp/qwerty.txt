A page directive (<%@page ... %>) sets the content type returned by the page.

Tag library directives (<%@taglib ... %>) import custom tag libraries.

jsp:useBean is a standard element that creates an object containing a collection of locales and initializes an identifier that points to that object.

JSP expression language expressions (${ }) retrieve the value of object properties. The values are used to set custom tag attribute values and create dynamic content.

Custom tags (see Chapter 8, Custom Tags in JSP Pages) set a variable (c:set), iterate over a collection of locale names (c:forEach), and conditionally insert HTML text into the response (c:if, c:choose, c:when, c:otherwise).

jsp:setProperty is another standard element that sets the value of an object property.
